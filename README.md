for my medical device as described in <a href="https://github.com/autonomous019/ahronov-bohm-cybersecurity">Cybersecurity Repository</a>. Currently, I am developing a non-invasive non-contact <a href="https://github.com/autonomous019/ahronov-bohm-cybersecurity/tree/main">Brain Computer Interface using the Aharonov-Bohm Effect</a> to sense brain activity. I started out as a Artist and Graphic Designer, then was a front end developer (html/js/css). Then learned backend technologies such as PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, NodeJS, then learned Data Science and Machine Learning which I use in my trading game application, <a href="https://www.ceilli.com">Ceilli.com</a>, which is built using Python and Sveltekit Framework on the front-end UI. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning angular momentum and entanglement science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on brain computer interface using ahronov-bohm effect
